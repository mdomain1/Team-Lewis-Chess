# Team-Lewis-Chess

This project is created by our OOP group in Mrs. Lewis's OOP class. Our group aims to build a GUI using Java 9 and JavaFX for a user to play chess (as the human player) against another user or the same user on the same computer (second player) (no networking functionality for example). If time permits, we would like to add functionality to import the Stockfish chess engine for a computer to play either against a computer or a human player. We would also like to add timers.

Project members are (for Instructor's reference or other):
  Marcus
  Adam
  Peggy

My Computer Science blog is located here, and my blog on this project is the blog that was submitted on April 22, 2018 (if I write a new blog, you may have to go through the history to find it.). ~Isaiah
