# Team-Lewis-Chess

This project is created by our OOP group in Mrs. Lewis's OOP class. Our group aims to build a GUI using Java 9 and JavaFX for a user to play chess (as the human player) against another user or the same user on the same computer (second player) (no networking functionality for example). If time permits, we would like to add functionality to import the Stockfish chess engine for a computer to play either against a computer or possibly a human player. We would also like to add timers.

Project members are (for Instructor's reference or other):
